## About AIOZ BeetleBot
During the COVID-19 pandemic, technologies are playing a crucial role in keeping our society functional in a time of lockdowns and quarantines. The pandemic opens up many new opportunities and markets for healthcare-related problems. The need of robots to assist people during this challenging time is undoubted. Robotic technologies would significantly help reduce the burden on Vietnamese doctors and healthcare workers to take care of hundreds of patients and thousands of people under quarantine. Moreover, we can’t afford to lose our doctors and health professionals to the virus in such critical times.

**AIOZ BeetleBot** was firstly developed with the mission of being a helpful assistant to reduce the risks of these frontline workers from regularly being exposed to the virus, hence helping them to stay safe and being able to contribute their best to the fight against the pandemic.
