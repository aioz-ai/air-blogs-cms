It's worth getting familiar with the basic concepts that comprise AIOZ AI Network as they
are used throughout the documentation. This knowledge will be helpful as you
proceed and is also cool to brag about amongst friends.

## Basics

### Blockchain Framework

### Federated Learning
Machine learning over a distributed dataset, where user devices (e.g., desktop, mobile phones, etc.) are utilized to collaboratively learn a shared prediction model while keeping all training data locally on the device. This approach decouples the ability to do machine learning from storing the data in the cloud.

### Deep Learning

A suite of tools for the automation of AI, primarily leveraging hierarchical neural networks, which has surpassed previous quality records and even human level performance for many intelligence tasks (e.g. DeepMinds AlphaGo project).

### Blockchain

Large, distributed dataset, where no-one can edit/delete an old entry, nor fake a new entry. The data is enforced by fundamental limits of computations (i.e. Proof of Work)

### Smart Contract

ataset stored on the Blockchain, which includes: **Data** (i.e. ledgers, events, statistics), **State** (todays ledger, todays events), **Code** (rules for changing state)
