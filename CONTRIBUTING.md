# How to write blog/article

## Blog

Blog articles should follow naming rules as `[YYYY-mm-dd-FILENAME].md`.  The `YYYY-mm-dd` is the publish datetime of this article, front end will use this info to order blog articles.

At the beginning of each blog article, you need to provide meta info of this article.  It looks like this:

```
---
last_modified_on: "<YYYY-MM-DD>"
id:  <url-id>
title: "<Your Blog Post Title"
description: "<Your Blog Post brief Description"
author_github: <author-github-link>
tags: ["type: post", "tag 1", "tag 2"]
---
```

`---` is the seprator of meta header.  Don't ignore that.

By default, all blog content will be displayed in the blog list view.  It might be desired or not.  If you only need to summarize the blog article in the list view, you can specify in the description tag or use `truncate` syntax sugar to achieve that.

```
Blog sample texts goes here, all content above "<!--truncate-->" will be displayed in list view, and the content below it will be shown in detail view.

<!--truncate-->

Main content continues
```

Static assets should be placed in a cloud folder (such as Gdrive, or visit [here](https://vision.aioz.io) for AIOZers ). When referencing assets in your articles, use syntax and path like this:

```

```

# Semantic Commit Messages

See how a minor change to your commit message style can make you a better programmer.

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

`<scope>` is optional

## Example

```
feat: allow overriding of webpack config
^--^  ^------------^
|     |
|     +-> Summary in present tense.
|
+-------> Type: chore, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, or test.
```

The various types of commits:

- `feat`: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
- `fix`: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
- `docs`: (changes to the documentation)
- `style`: (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
- `refactor`: (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
- `test`: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
- `chore`: (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)

Use lower case not title case!
