The system helps you to control all access through a mobile application. This article will give you an overview of the usage and the features that our access control system provides.

Our mobile application allows visitors to request appointments remotely. First, you need to sign up for an account. Through a few steps of providing personal information, confirming ID, you can make an appointment.

You can select a date, time and add a note to your appointment, for example, topics, purposes, or participants of the meetings. After confirming that information, your request will be sent to the admin. You need to wait for the admin to confirm. As soon as the admin approves, your appointment will be automatically booked to the system.

An automatic security base will be installed at the entrance. It resembles a security platform on highways but different in that this base is fully automated, with access control systems being integrated.

On the appointment date, you need to verify your face at the security base. The system will automatically notify the admin to automatically confirm if you are the person who has an appointment.

If the system takes too long to identify your face - this could be due to many factors like weather, clothes, or hairstyle - you verify yourself by scanning a QR code instead. To scan the code, you need to connect to the area's wifi through the access control application.

Once you come in, the system records the entry time and date, and when you leave, the system automatically removes your name from the booking list. All of this information will be updated to the mobile application for the admin to check at any time.

All operations are completely automatic. It is fast, simple, and not relying on humans. Moreover, our system ensures that there are as few touchpoints as possible. Throughout the process, you are not required to contact any device other than your smartphone directly. This system is simple, powerful, and yet very safe for everyone.
