### AI is changing the filmmaking industry

You must have heard a lot about the "Technology revolution 4.0" that artificial intelligence is a core factor. Nowadays, filmmakers are using AI to improve production, come up with an effective marketing strategy and develop audience preferences. AI has already infiltrated filmmaking, and it's changing this industry.

Do you remember Thanos, who wants to wipe out a haft of life in the universe in Avenger? To create such a digital character, the Marvel Studio resorted to AI. Digital Domain, the firm that joins to work visual effects on the film, used a machine learning system called Masquerade to make the motion of the character performance more natural. The actor had to wear a helmet camera which tracked his facial movements by 100 to 150 dots, and this net dot was in relatively low-quality rendering. Then, the Domain team fed the data from the camera into a machine-learning algorithm to find suitable shapes with high resolution.

AI also can be utilized to help you write scripts for movies. I'm very impressed when I hear about Benjamin and a filmmaking AI researched and developed by NYU. Suppose you fed it a tone of science-fiction scripts. It can create for you a new script that learning from the data. AI algorithms analyze, understand and sort the input data to come up with a new story. Benjamin scripted a short sci-fi film about three people known as "Sunspring". Although now it's still unconventional, we believe that when this technology becomes really smart in the next few years, it will be a boom for the filmmaking industry.

An element that characterizes AI is optimizing your task. AI can offer movie producers a simplified process to produce a movie. It can help to automatic of analyzing script process, planning efficiency schedule, budgeting, etc. It saves filmmakers a lot of time.

No matter what major you work for, the promotion of the product is always a challenging task. For the film industry, the first thing you need to do marketing for the movie is an impressive trailer. Do you believe that AI can assist in building a movie trailer? It's totally yes. In 2016, IBM produced the first movie trailer - Morgan, by applying AI technology. And do you know how it was created? IBM used Waston, a tool that helps to arrange visual and audio analysis to determine the most salient scenes for a trailer from the movie Morgan that the producer can edit and arrange together. Waston analyzed thousands of thriller sci-fi movie trailers and learned from audiences' reactions to automatically generate a trailer.

Not only movie trailer, the success of promotion a movie need more factors. AI algorithm is training to ensure that movie will be a hit. AI is used to predict and develop audience preferences. Movie studios can base on this to plan for their marketing strategy. Qloo, an AI platform that helps you to identify viewer performances and predict consumer taste. It changes the way we market movies to maximize film revenues.

As you can see that there is a lot of AI technology in filmmaking. Movie producers are leveraging the power of AI to boost a new cinematic era. The interest in AI is fascinating, which gradually change the media and entertainment world. We believe that shortly AI will be more competent and intelligent to work as human assistants to raise the standard of filmmaking.
