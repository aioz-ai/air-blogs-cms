### For Buyer

The data of the real estate industry is quite large and most of it is public, but it is still tricky for buyers to access information because there are many agents. Moreover, the real estate buying and selling process are pretty complicated, and buyers have to visit the house to see the actual condition of the house, so finding a place that suits their wishes is quite difficult and takes a lot of time.

When you would like to buy a house, the first thing you do is definitely surf the web to find information. Now you can find exactly what you need with the help of AI-integrated technologies. For example, virtual reality, data visualization, 3D modeling, and drones, which can record the property and its surroundings, create virtual tours, giving buyers the most authentic experiences without having to go from house to house for consideration.
