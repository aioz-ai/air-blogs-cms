## So what is KYC?

It's not strange if someone does not know what KYC is because we have already been familied with doing everything in handiwork. However, in a bank transaction such as creating an account or applying for a credit card, how do you determine a stranger is actually who he or she claims to be? More and more identities are stolen, a stiff paper can be degraded.

KYC stands for "Know Your Customer", this is the tool that helps finance firms identify and verify their clients before or during the time they do bank transactions. This system is created to ensure your clients are authentic and minor in personal information theft, which can automatically detect information in ID cards and face recognition.

## And why we need KYC?

### KYC makes it's easier!

Identifying customers by meeting face to face to check documents is too complicated and takes a lot of time. Some clients are unwilling to wait for a long time and may not be satisfied with your service. By using KYC, customers do not need to fill in too many forms. We need less than three seconds to detect and store customers' information data in the systems, and everything is all automatic.

I want to create an account. Banking working time from 8 AM to 5 PM, it's also mine. So how I go to the bank and do that? With KYC, there is no problem! Some transactions you can make at any time, anywhere.

### KYC can save your time, money, and more!

If you're running a business, saving costs is the first thing you want. You have thousands of identity verification per day, which require lots of staff to check and confirm step by step. This operation takes plenty of time and money. Moreover, we also can not guarantee that the entry data process one hundred percent correct.

- Save human resources
