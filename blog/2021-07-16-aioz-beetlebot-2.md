From our strong belief that robots will become close friends with everyone in the near future, we have decided to develop the BeetleBot, an indoor delivery robot.

## What is our inspiration?

Do you know Wall-E? A cute robot that works tirelessly to clean out the Earth. It’s one of my favorite movies when I was young. That is the nature of robots. They are born to be obedient, handful, and laborious. Wall-E reflects exactly what we want our Beetlebot to be.

Moreover, our inspiration also came from the *Onthophagus Taurus -* the strongest animal on Earth. It was found to be able to pull a whopping 1,141 times its body weight. Small but can carry heavy objects is one of the outstanding specialties of the beetles. Our target is to create a robot that is like the beetles: small but being a solid carry.

They are born to be obedient, handful, and laborious.

## Why indoor?

These days, the need for indoor transportation is just as great as the outdoors, especially in restaurants, hotels, schools, hospitals, and even offices. Through the COVID year 2020, it is increased dramatically.

The Covid-19 has changed many aspects, including people's perspectives about robots. When we have to limit direct contact but still need to maintain transportation, robots are the answer. Robotics delivery promises much lower cost as well as safety and low energy use.

In addition to Ottonomy, Cheetah Mobile in China has its [FANBOT](https://thespoon.tech/cheetah-mobiles-fanbot-is-a-vending-machine-on-wheels/), which is a mobile vending machine that roams around hotel lobbies and cinemas. During quarantine, a robot dog was released to enforce social distancing in Singapore park. A hospital in China where robots treated coronavirus patients. Those have inspired us a lot to keep developing and improving our Beetlebot.

With the main feature as delivering, we design the robot with flexible disassembly capabilities to integrate more other functions onto the robot, making the most use of the mobility. Our robot can do various services such as delivery (as default), disinfection function, remote calling, garbage collection, etc.

Here at AIOZ, we always keep improving our products. We will use this indoor robot for indoor purposes and as a pedal for developing outdoor robots in the future.
