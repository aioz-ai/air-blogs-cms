The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a lot of loss, but at the same time, it also opened a new way of managing people and organizing collective activities. It has changed our way of thinking. In 2020, we observed an explosion of online management applications, robots, and other automation software to minimize direct contact between people. Inspired by that, we have developed an Access Control System application. We want to introduce a new, safe, simple way to manage your visitors and employees through this application. We believe that the system opens a new way to reduce touchpoints in COVID era and the future of driving visitors.

### **Why use an access control system?**

**Keys and cards have become less flexible.**

Keys or cards are popular forms of physical access control. This method is used in many small organizations. However, even for a small company, using physical access forms has several limitations – especially when the organization gets more extensive.

- The risk of losing keys/cards: you cannot know if you lost your keys or if someone tried to steal them. As a result, to make sure the lost key can’t be misused, you have to replace the lock. You then need to distribute new keys to everyone who needs access to that door.
- Too many keys can confuse: Keys are challenging to manage. For each room or building, you need a specific key or card to access. If someone needs to enter many different facilities and spaces, they’ll need a large number of keys, which are inconvenient to carry and use.
- Keys don’t leave an audit trail: You don’t know who’s entered or at what time they entered if they used keys.

**Our system helps to reduce the number of touchpoints**

Scientists have warned that viruses can live on some surfaces for several days. One way you can reduce the spread of germs and viruses is by removing or reducing physical touchpoints. For example, with the AIOZ visitor management application, employees and visitors confirm their identities by scanning a QR code at the door.

Visitor registration is quick and can be done quickly through a mobile application. Once you've done registering on the application, an individualized badge is generated. You can request a specific visit to the administrator, such as clearance level, access area, or visit time. We also combine KYC systems to increase your security standards. When you reach a checkpoint, our KYC system will automatically capture your face and implement a FaceID program to identify you. These quick and consistent checks ensure that only the right people are allowed to enter. At the end of the visit, our system signs out the visitor.

We also combine the KYC system to increase your security standards.

This simple yet powerful visitor registration process forms the basis of a robust security platform. Registering all visitors through AIOZ Access Control System ensures that you are in control and always have in your hands the complete records of your visitor traffic, strengthens both your company and your visitors' security.

We will introduce to you further information about this system in the next part of this series.

The end of part 01.
