## How can you define an ideal workplace culture?
It does not matter you are in which majors, and the workplace environment is still an essential factor that affects your business. However, it is not simply described as you thought. Company culture represents the character and personality of your organization. How to build a workplace environment where every individual feels happy and comfortable to be a part of?

For AIOZ, we believe that a freelance environment would be suitable for our young, dynamic and creative developers. It provides opportunities for all members to improve their skills with challenging tasks and creates an open working space with flexible working time.

As AIOZers, we are confident that we are one, a team with well-built connections; we support each other and learn from each other. It is not hard to find a company with modern equipment facilities, but a great leader is a gold.

AIOZ's leaders are the one who makes those around them better. The way they interact with employees is approachable with no blaming or ego. Encouraging when team members are under pressure of meeting a deadline, they comprehend what is best for everyone. This is also one of the factors that make every AIOZ member has a strong teamwork spirit. However, they also have their independence to complete assigned tasks if required.

AIOZers discuss throughout workday

For running a company, AIOZers are willing to take up challenges in many different aspects of AI technology. We work with all passion and beliefs. As Steve Jobs said: "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it."

Having a small workplace party always is a good idea to refresh your employees. It also reinforces co-worker relationships. Sometimes, finger food or just a tea break can give your team members more motivation to work. At AIOZ, we celebrate member's birthdays every month, we also have parties on special occasions. We create these moments for everyone to get closer in a fun and enjoyable way.
