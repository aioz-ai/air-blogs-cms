In the previous post,  we have discussed about multitask learning and object retrieval system. In this post, we will discover imbalance data problem and the main proposal.

## 1. Imbalanced Data Problem
Imbalanced data are the problem in machine learning in which the class distribution is not uniform between the classes. Usually, they are composed of two types of classes: the majority classes (positive) and the minority classes (negative). Recent research in machine learning shows that using an uneven distribution of class examples during learning can cause learning algorithms with misleading performance (bias). It means a classifier with high accuracy in the majority, but it gives poor accuracy in the minority class. In the case of attribute learning, an imbalance occurs if the number of instances in some attributes varies significantly in quantity compared to other attributes. To deal with this situation, in general, adjusting the distribution of classes is an essence of many popular methods to handle imbalanced data problems.
- **Data sampling**: sampling-based methods such as upsampling, downsampling, or data augmentation are considered to be a solution for imbalanced data problems. In addition to making data more balanced, they can help reduce training time (downsampling) or make the learning process more efficient (upsampling). The best approach we know is SMOTE which can solve the situation by automatically generating additional data (upsampling) based on the original dataset. However, these methods increase overfitting when training (upsampling) or losing (downsampling) data. Data augmentation is proved to be robust in dealing with imbalanced training data. However, this method takes up a lot of training resources, and it is difficult to find a proper augmented dataset which is large enough to train. And it is very difficult (or impossible) to augment data to balance the attributes in datasets because each object usually has many attributes.

- **Architecture, loss function, and metric configuration**: other methods exploit network architectures, loss functions, or metrics to address the imbalanced data problem when training. The methods (at the algorithm level) enhance the existing classifier by adjusting algorithms to recognize the smaller classes. Internal techniques provide general solutions for the imbalanced data problem because these are not specific to particular problems. These approaches show better performance compared to data sampling; however, they are often difficult to implement as well as configure in the future. Therefore, they are not always the best choice in dynamic retrieval systems in which the attributes have a large variety.Threshold and output-based configuration: instead of generating more data or making changes in the model, these methods find the best thresholds based on output. The essence of these methods is to use scores that show the probability to indicate which test sample is a member of a class in producing several learners by changing the threshold for class members. These methods are particularly effective in resolving imbalanced data problems without changing the configuration in the model. Moreover, they also do not reduce data or increase overfitting. SVM is proposed to find these thresholds. However, Boughorbel et al. proposed Matthews’ correlation coefficient (MCC) to deal with imbalanced data in classification. Although SVM shows better performance, MCC consumes less resources and processing time compared to it. Based on the methods of many other researchers, we found a solution for multitask learning that is suitable to retrieval systems using the end-to-end DCNN for training and MCC for estimating thresholds to get final outputs.

## 2. Materials and Methods: CFOR System

The CFOR system is very complicated but easy to understand. We focus on the main points of the CFOR system.

CFOR is an object retrieval system integrated by object ontology, a local MDNN (NASNet and ResNet), and an imbalanced data solver (MCC) to improve the performance of the large-scale object retrieval system from the coarse-grained level (categories) to the fine-grained level (attributes) (see Figure below).

**Query Image**. For traditional content-based image retrieval systems, with query images, one is just able to retrieve the images ranked on visual similarity to query image. It is very difficult (or impossible) for users to provide semantic information to the system based on query images. But the interesting thing is that, in our CFOR system, this challenge has been solved. The semantic information of the query image is extracted automatically by the category and attribute classification system, and users can use the extracted semantic information during the retrieval process.An example is how users can query “Asian face” with only a query image; here, “Asian race” is semantic information. The traditional retrieval methods cannot meet this requirement because of the curse of semantic gap. And the CFOR system can recognize “Asian race” and use it to retrieve. Another example for “Fashion” object based on our CFOR system is described in Figure 3.

From the query image, based on fashion ontology, the detector quickly identifies the region (Top and Bottom; see Figure 4).

After that, the user selects the region (Top; see Figure  5); the CFOR system quickly identifies the category related to the Top region (category: Blazer). Later, specific concepts and visual concepts are extracted according to Blazer, and users can select some of them (or all of them) to retrieve. For user-friendly interaction, only extracted regions, categories, and attributes are shown. Other information such as global deep features, attribute vector, ontology, or group of attributes which are used as searching input of the system will not be displayed. In such a way, users can order the CFOR system at the semantic level, and they can achieve the results that match both the content and semantics of the query image.
