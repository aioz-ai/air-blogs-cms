In the previous post,  we have discussed about the imbalance data problem annd the overview of the object retrieval system. The CFOR system is organized into two main phases: offline phase and online phase. In this post, we will discover the overall of the online phase and offline phase of the proposal.

## 1. Overview of Offline Phase
This phase is designed to generate object ontology, database, indexing file and region detection model, category classification model, and attribute classification model.
- Object ontology is designed manually based on professional experience and public dataset for the community. It is organized into a hierarchical semantic tree with three main levels: region level, category level, and attribute level.
- The database is generated to store the preextracted features, regions, categories, and attributes of all images in the dataset. It supports to reduce the online retrieval time and provides the necessary semantic information for each retrieved image.
- The indexing file which is created to support fast mapping in the online phase of the CFOR retrieval system is the key to perform the retrieval task at runtime.
- Regions, categories, and attributes are learned automatically based on the local MDNN. Detection models and classification models are created to extract or predict semantic information of the query image and dataset such as regions, categories, and attributes.

## 2. Overview of Online Phase
This phase of the CFOR system is designed to run the retrieval process including object detection, semantic information extraction, and query expansion and retrieval.

In the object detection stage, we use the trained object detector to detect objects in the query image. In the semantic information extraction stage, the built-in object ontology and classification models are used for extracting the necessary semantic information of each identified object. The extracted semantic information and deep global features of each detected object passed through the searching system along with the indexing file to quickly compute the score between the query object and the sample in the database. Retrieval is applied to rank and export the most similar images to the query object and their relevant information. Query expansion is optional and used to increase the retrieval performance with a trade-off for retrieval time.

The power of mutually supporting object ontology, local MDNN, and imbalanced data solver in the CFOR system: Figure.1 shows the operation of the CFOR system with the interaction of the three main modules object ontology, a local MDNN, and an imbalanced data solver to optimize the learning strategy and improve the overall retrieval performance on large-scale datasets.

Object ontology supports conducting the training flow (with a local MDNN) and retrieval flow (from the coarse-grained level to the fine-grained level) to save computational costs in the training stage and retrieval stage on large-scale datasets. Training flow also paves a way for applying transfer learning which may improve the convergence rate of deep networks. Object ontology which could transform the global imbalance of data into local imbalance of data based on fine-grained groups makes the imbalanced data problem easier to deal with.

Deep multitask NN supports to link the object ontology to the raw data effectively at the category level and attribute level by exploiting inner-group correlations and intergroup correlations. The object ontology supports to update the system at the local level with parallel processing based on the local MDNN. Therefore, CFOR is updated in a flexible manner on large-scale datasets with many variations.And the proposed imbalanced data solver based on MCC which addresses data imbalance has contributed effectively to increasing the quality of object ontology implementation without adjusting network architecture and data augmentation.

Algorithm and demonstration of the CFOR system: an online phase and offline phase (Figures  2 and  3) are used to analyze tasks in the CFOR system. These phases will be demonstrated in detail in this section.

Besides, the CFOR system can be put into use as a general solution for retrieval. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, fashion objects with attributes are selected in experiments.

In the next post, we will mention the offline phase in details.
