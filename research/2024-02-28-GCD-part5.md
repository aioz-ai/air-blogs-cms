In previous part, we have discovered the experimental setups and quality analysis. In this part, let investigate consistency  and diversity factors in dance generation.

## 1. Diversity and Consistency Analysis
Table.1 presents an in-depth analysis of our method's performance across seven evaluation metrics by adjusting the parameter $\gamma$ to control the consistency and diversity of the generated group choreographies. 
The findings reveal that our GCD with high consistency setting ($\gamma = 1$), performs better than other settings in terms of MMC, GMC, and TIR metrics, whereas the high diversity setting ($\gamma=-1$) achieves better results in the GenDiv metric. Meanwhile, the default model shows the best performance in both realism metrics (FID and GMR).   {It can also be seen that the model is relatively robust to the physical plausibility score (PFC) as there are no noticeable differences among the metric in the three settings. This implies that our model is able to create group animation with different consistency or diversity levels without compromising the plausibility of the movements too much.} More interestingly, we found that there are indeed positive correlations between the two measures MMC, GMR, and the trade-off parameter. It is clear that these metrics are better when the consistency level increases. This is reasonable as we expect higher correspondence between the motion and the music (MMC) or higher correlation of the group motions (GMR) when the consistency level grows, which also agrees with the definition of these metrics.

Consistency setups in GCD lead to more similar movements between dancers. As a result, this similarity contributes to high scores in  MMC, GMR, and TIR metrics.  In contrast, the diversity setups can synthesize more complex motions with greater variation between dancers as measured by the GenDiv metric, but this also makes it more challenging to reach high values of FID, MMC, and TIR, compared with other setups. In addition, Figure 1 shows an example of correlations between motion beats and music beats under high consistency and diversity settings. The music beats are extracted using the beat tracking algorithm from the Librosa library. Notably, the velocity curves in high consistency setting display relatively similar shapes, whereas in the high diversity scenario, the curves are clearly distinguished among dancers.

The solid curve represents the kinetic velocity of each dancer over time and the vertical dashed line depicts the music beats of the sequence. The motion beats can be detected as the local extrema from the kinetic velocity curve.</center>*

Despite the greater variations in high diversity setting, we can observe that the generated motions are matched with the music as the music beats are mostly located near the extrema of the motion curves in both settings.
The experiment indicates that our model can faithfully capture different aspects of group choreography with different settings, including diversity and synchrony of the motions. This demonstrates the potential of our method towards various dance applications such as dance training or composing. Furthermore, our method can also produce distinctively different animation sequences under the same setting while adhering to the input music.  
It is also important to note that all three setups of GCD significantly outperform other baseline models. This verifies the effectiveness of our proposed approach and shows that it can create high-fidelity group dance animations in any setting.  For a more detailed visualization of the results, please refer to Figure 2.

## 2. Number of Dancers Analysis

Table 2 provides insights into results obtained when generating arbitrarily different numbers of dancers using our proposed GCD in the neutral setting. In general, FID, GMR, and GMC metrics do not exhibit a clearly strong correlation with the number of generated dancers but display diverse and varied results. The MMC metric consistently shows its stability across all setups.

As the number of generated dancers increases, the generation diversity (GenDiv) decreases while the trajectory intersection frequency (TIF) increases. However, it is worth noting that the differences observed in these metrics are relatively minor compared to those produced by GDanceR. This implies that our method can effectively control consistency and diversity, significantly reducing the chances of collisions between dancers and maintaining the overall quality of generated group dance motions.

For a detailed visualization of results, please refer to Figure 3. These results underscore the robustness and flexibility of our method in generating group dance motions across varying numbers of dancers while ensuring consistency, diversity, and avoiding collisions between performers.

## 3. Long-term Analysis

To evaluate the efficacy of the guidance signal in GCD for creating long-term group dance sequences, we conducted a comparative analysis between GCD and the baseline model GDanceR. The experiment involved musical pieces of different durations: 15 seconds, 30 seconds and 60 seconds. We show the results with the guidance parameter $\gamma = 0.5$ to enforce consistency with the music over a long duration. For more detailed information, please refer to Figure 5 and our supplementary video.

While both methods produce satisfactory results in the first few seconds of the animations (e.g., about 5-6 seconds), GDanceR starts to exhibit floating and unrealistic movements or freeze into a mean pose in the later period of the sequence. Figure 4 shows the Motion changes comparison between our GCD method and GdanceR. The motion change magnitudes are calculated as average differences of the kinetic features between consecutive frames. It is evident that the motion change magnitude of GDanceR is gradually lower and approaching zero in the later half of the 60-second music piece, whereas our method can preserve high magnitudes and variations over time. This is because GDanceR generates almost frozen dance choreographies during this period. In contrast, the group dance motions produced by GCD remain natural with diverse movements throughout the entire duration of all music samples.

These findings confirm that our approach can effectively address the problem of  motion generation in long-horizon group dance scenarios. It maintains the motion quality and dynamics of the dance motions, ensuring that the created animations remain visually appealing throughout extended periods. This highlights the advantage of the contrastive strategy to enhance the consistency of the movements of dancers with their group and the music, resulting in significant improvements for long-term dance sequence generation compared to the baseline GDanceR.
