Welcome to the concluding part of our series! In this final installment, we'll delve deeper into the intricacies of the search system that accompanies our proposal. Additionally, we'll conduct a comprehensive evaluation to gauge the overall effectiveness and performance of our solution. Let's explore the various aspects of the search functionality and analyze how it contributes to the success of our proposed system. Let's embark on this journey together as we wrap up our discussion and reflect on the insights gained throughout this series.

## 1.  Searching and Indexing Method in the CFOR System
To adapt our retrieval system for large-scale datasets, we've developed indexes for the CFOR system to facilitate nonexhaustive similarity search using GPU acceleration. Leveraging the searching algorithm outlined by Johnson et al. (referenced as "billion-scale similarity search with GPUs"), we've implemented it within the CFOR system for retrieval tasks. In searching, the CFOR system enhances accuracy by reducing the search space through additional information such as regions, categories, and attributes. For indexing, the object ontology aids in creating multi-indexing files to minimize search time. Our focus is on similarity search in vector collections using the L2 distance in the k-selection algorithm.

In the realm of searching, we distinguish between exact search (exhaustive search) and compressed search (greedy nonexhaustive search). 

- Exact search: Almost all searching algorithms in this type try to compute the full pairwise distance between the query and each data point in the database sequentially or using the index file.
- Compressed-Domain search: Almost all searching algorithms in this type try to compute distance between the query and each data point in the database by applying space transformation, encoding, subspace splitting, or hashing. These methods can help improve searching time by using index files, but they have a trade-off in searching accuracy.

## 2. Data

Our fashion retrieval system was built on a subset of approximately 300,000 images of DeepFashion. In the DeepFashion dataset, objects from different aspects are caught in complicated background. The input image in the dataset is annotated with different labels based on details (fine-grained) of input of the current model concern, i.e., rich annotation. The samples given in Figures 1 and 2 show more details about the DeepFashion dataset.

In testing, we employ part of the benchmark data to fine tune the trained models. We ensure that there are no fashion item overlaps between fine-tuning and testing sets. The dataset includes ∼220,000 images of the training set, 40,000 images of the validating set, and 40,000 images of the testing set split. However, in attribute learning, we limited the number of attribute labels used for testing and the number of training images for specific attributes to make an imbalanced attribute dataset so as to prove our proposed methods. 

## 3. Results and Discussion

In the CFOR system, object ontology is useful in controlling training flow which impacts the performance of object category classification and attribute multitask classification. For object category classification, ontology controls the amount of training data through concepts. For attribute multitask classification, ontology manages local grouping which directly affects the performance of the proposed local imbalanced data solver on the large-scale dataset.

In this section, we will evaluate the effectiveness of different deep networks with the support of ontology on both category classification and attribute multitask classification in the CFOR system to pick out the best architecture for training the system. We will also compare our results with FashionNet.

### Category Classification
We compare the performance between different deep architectures including NASNet, ResNet-18, ResNet-101, FashionNet, NASNet with average pooling dropout (NASNet APD) (proposed by us), and ResNet with average pooling dropout (ResNet APD) (proposed by us). These experiments will be evaluated by top-_k_ accuracy (Figure.3). Our target is to find out the best possible architecture to apply as a core network of the CFOR system. This step can be mentioned as a preparation step before applying the CFOR system for fashion retrieval.

The result of category classification by ResNet-18 APD is higher than 1.23% (at _k_= 1) after removing nodes and making average pooling in the ResNet-18 architecture (compared with the original ResNet-18 architecture). This increased value is 0.93% with the ResNet-101 architecture (compared with the original ResNet-101 architecture) and 0.02% with the NASNet v3 architecture (compared with the original NASNet v3 architecture). The ResNet-101 APD architecture (the best architecture addressed) outperformed the FashionNet architecture (the best performing architecture in category classification on the DeepFashion dataset versus others such as WTBI or DARN), and the value is 4.6% with _k_= 3 and 2.58% with _k_ = 5. Based on the above experimental results, the ResNet-101 architecture provides better classification and higher performance compared to others (NASNet and ResNet-18). For this reason, we propose ResNet-101 as the core network architecture for training classification models.

### Attribute Learning
Attribute multitask learning is an important part of the CFOR system. In this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed local imbalanced data solver with MCC in dealing with the imbalanced attribute data on the large-scale fashion dataset.

Precision is the proportion of relevant instances among the retrieved instances which consider both true positives and false positives in each attribute. However, the number of true positives and false positives is bias because of the imbalanced data problem. Thus, precision can also be affected by the imbalanced data problem. Otherwise, recall, which cares about true-positive labels but not false-positive labels, will be used to evaluate experiments because of its good reflection for fewer data attributes.

Local MTL gets over STL and MTL in 28/35 attributes with a 54.70% recall rate (higher than that in STL (17.06%) and that in MTL (28.70%)). While a single task shows its weakness in fewer data attributes and multitasks get struggled with the serious imbalanced problem and lesser intergroup correlations in fashion data, local MTL can lower their negative influences as well as widen the positive effect of inner-group correlations on attribute learning. Thus, local MTL gets over STL and MTL in 13/15 fewer sample attributes (Figure.4).

Based on the experiment, comparison of chic, solid, and maxi attributes which have equal accuracy between MTL with and without MCC shows that MTL with MCC had higher recall compared to that without MCC in 20/35 remaining attributes. The overall performance increases about 3%. For attributes with fewer data, MTL with MCC had higher recall compared to that without MCC in 9/14 attributes. The overall performance for these fewer data attributes increases 5.14% (see Figure  5 for more details).

###  Retrieval in CFOR System Results
In this experiment, we test the retrieval ability of the CFOR system by using MAP from 1 retrieval result for each query (MAP@1) to 30 retrieval results for each query (MAP@30) so as to evaluate the effectiveness. The similarity retrieval experiment will check whether the extracted attributes in retrieved images are matched with ground-truth attributes in query image. The retrieval method will be based on deep features and over 35 attributes. After experimenting in 35 attributes belonging to 5 groups, the starting MAP@5 is acceptable (hovering 0.531) which shows the effectiveness of the searching method. The MAP@30 hovers 0.815, and the trend keeps rising which shows consistency and stabilization of information prediction methods in the CFOR system. A simple visualization of the retrieval process in the CFOR system is shown in Figure.6.

## 4. Conclusion
This work presents the coarse-to-fine object retrieval system, a learning framework for e-commerce online retrieval, which is supported to deal with large-scale imbalanced datasets. The framework can impact input and output as well as reconstruct datasets from the coarse-grained level to the fine-grained level and is believed to be an effective method in improving learning performance designed for retrieval. For input reconstruction, the framework based on ontology is used for threading training flow, local grouping in multitask attribute learning, and hierarchical storage and retrieval. For output optimization, we take advantage of MCC to minimize the effect of the imbalanced dataset on multitask attribute learning.

Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the applicability of object ontology in improving training flow, the effectiveness of different deep networks (ResNet and NASNet) applied on important tasks in fine-grained retrieval, and the usefulness of local multitask attribute learning and an MCC-based imbalanced data solver in attribute multitask learning. The CFOR system is designed to have flexibility so that it can be optimized easily in the future.
